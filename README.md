Image Base Captcha 

CAPTCHA : A CAPTCHA is a type of challenge-response 
test used in computing to determine whether or not the 
user is human. 

 CAPTCHAs are, by definition, fully automated, requiring 
 little human maintenance or intervention to administer,
 producing benefits in cost and reliability. The most 
 common, typical CAPTCHA Code is a text based image 
 with distorted letters of different fonts, blurry or confusing 
 backgrounds with random lines. The user is asked to 
 reenter the letters or numbers to obtain services. If the 
 user fails, then the access is denied.  
 
 CAPTCHA technique is basically a challenge response test 
 which involves a computer (server) initiating a task for the 
 user to complete. If the user completes it successfully then 
 the user is considered as “human” else it is treated as a 
 “web-bot”.

1.INTRODUCTION

This section gives a scope description and overview of Everything included in 
this Project Report. Also, the purpose for this document is described and system 
overview along with goal and vision are listed. 

1.1Purpose 
Captcha using Python Project. It will illustrate the purpose and complete 
declaration for the development of system. It will also explain system 
constraints, interface and interactions with users. This document is primarily 
intended to anyone who wants to get an overview of how Captcha works, its 
outcomes and possible usages in future. 

1.2System Overview 

A CAPTCHA system presents a visitor with an obscured word, words, or phrase. 
The obscuring is usually achieved by warping the words, distorting the 
background, or segmenting the word by adding lines.Users are asked to decode 
the image and select the image in the correct order (they may or may not be case 
sensitive) before submitting the form. Upon form submission, the response is 
verified, and users are either taken to the next step or presented with an error. 

1.3 Problem Statement 

Nowdays on every platform Bot is main reason for very high traffic on internet. 
“Bot” generally refers to any program that is set to automatically complete some 
process, whether it’s posting news on Twitter or leaving spam in website 
comment sections. Used correctly, these programs are fairly useful, but they can 
also be used to generate useless/ad-ridden/malicious content, overwhelm a site 
with signups, rig online poll results, scrape email addresses, or do any number of 
other unpleasant things. 
It’s just best not to let them in. To overcome this problem we need Captcha 
system. CAPTCHA motto goes, to create a task that is “Easy for people, hard 
for bots.” 

1.4 Goal & Vision 

The main goal of CAPTCHA is to put forth a test which is simple and straight 
forward for any human to answer but for a computer, it is almost impossible to 
solve. CAPTCHAs can be used by websites that offer services like online polls 
and registration forms. 
Web-based email services like Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail offer free email 
accounts for their users. 
However, upon each sign-up process, CAPTCHAs are used to prevent 
spammers from using a bot to generate hundreds of spam mail accounts. 

2. Requirements Specification 

2.1Hardware Requirements 

To access this application, you only need a PC/Laptop with Python install on it. 
Also check if python GUI working on it or not. 

2.2Software Requirements 

For this system to work you need python compiler to write the code and execute 
it. You also need to install the necessary package for python GUI to work. After 
executing you can use this software in new window which will appear after 
executing the code. 

3.Procedure 

First open the python compiler. 

After opening python compiler, type the code and attach all images required by 
the program. 

After typing all the code, execute it. 

After executing new window will open where registration number, password and 
verify captcha option will be present. Type the required detail and after that type 
the captcha shown and verify it. 

If you are verified then you are logged in otherwise you need to fill all the 
details again. 

4. Constraints and Assumptions 

Image Captcha only available for image not for any other meanlike audio or 
any mathematical calculations. It only supports English language and will 
not work with any other language. It is note case sensitive so writing in any 
case will work. Since this project is of small level so only limited number of 
captchas are  available.
